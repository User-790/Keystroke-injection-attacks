# Rubber-Ducky-Scripts
These are custom Rubber Ducky Scripts to use against Windows 10/11
Let me know if you have any suggestions or issues with the scripts, this is a beta project I have taken upon myself and will keep the payloads up to do as I discover more about the abilities of the USB Rubber Ducky.
THESE SCRIPTS ARE DIRECTED SOLEY TOWARDS WINDOWS 11 COMPUTERS
