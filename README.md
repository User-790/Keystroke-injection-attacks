# Rubber-Ducky-Scripts
These are custom Rubber Ducky Scripts to use against Windows 10/11
Let me know if you have any suggestions or issues with the scripts, this is a beta project I have taken upon myself and will keep the payloads up to do as I discover more about the abilities of the USB Rubber Ducky.

THESE SCRIPTS ARE DIRECTED SOLEY TOWARDS WINDOWS 11 COMPUTERS
You can also compile multiple scripts together to accomidate your needs and edit them as well using (https://ducktoolkit.com/)
There are messages explaining the code before each "REM" if you have any questions don't be afraid to ask. :)

Please use responsibly... just because you can, should you?
