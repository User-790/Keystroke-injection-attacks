# Rubber-Ducky-Scripts
These are custom Rubber Ducky Scripts to use against Windows 10/11 computers.
Let me know if you have any suggestions or issues with the scripts, this is a beta project I have taken upon myself to learn and study from. I will keep the payloads up date as I discover more about the abilities of the USB Rubber Ducky.

THESE SCRIPTS ARE DIRECTED SOLEY TOWARDS WINDOWS 10/11 COMPUTERS
You can also compile multiple scripts together to accomidate your needs and edit them as well using (https://ducktoolkit.com/) and (https://payloadstudio.com/community/)
There are messages explaining the code before each "REM" if you have any questions don't be afraid to ask. :)

Please use responsibly... "just because you can, should you?"
